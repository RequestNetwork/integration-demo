# Request Network API integration demo

This project has two directories
1. `rn-test-backend` - a fastify application serving as the demo backend for integrating with Request Network
2. `rn-test-frontend` - a React application that calls the demo backend and executes payments

You need to run each of them separately.

To get your environment variables, please consult our [docs](https://docs.request.network/)
